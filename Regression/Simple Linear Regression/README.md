Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
* One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor or independent variable.
* The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.
Simple linear regression gets its adjective "simple," because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable. In contrast, multiple linear regression gets its adjective "multiple," because it concerns the study of two or more predictor variables.
in most cases the relationship between the variables is not perfect and if we plot them on a scatter graph we will have a hard time
to find the best line who describes the connection with minimmum error.
let's take the MSE (mean squer error) function to measure the error between the depended variable to the predicted depended value,
we can describe it like this:

y  = independed value
y' = predicted depended value
n  = number of depended values

MSE = (1/n)*SUM((y-y')^2)
